# Mailnotify

A simple mail notifier, which shows the count of unread
mails with libnotify for imap accounts.


### Requirements

- Python 3
- Python 3 modules:
    - imaplib
    - gi.repository
- libnotify
- A Notification provider*(e.g. dunst)*

*And its dependencies...*


### Installation

- Clone this repo to `/opt/`
- Copy the `mailnotifyrc` from `conf/` to `~/.mailnotifyrc`
- Copy the systemd-user-service from `systemd/` to `.config/systemd/user/`
- Reload your user-services with `systemctl --user daemon-reload`
- Start the service with `systemctl --user start mail-notify.service`
- *Optional:* To start the systemd service at the beginning of your user session, enable it
    with `systemctl --user enable mail-notify.service`


### Configuration

Fill in your account data into the json object in your `mailnotifyrc`.

For example:

```
{
    "accounts":[
        {
            "name":"Mail1",
            "mail":"mail1@mail.com",
            "server":"imap.mail.com",
            "username":"mail1",
            "password":"password"
        },
        {
            "name":"Mail2",
            "mail":"mail2@mail.com",
            "server":"imap.mail.com",
            "username":"mail2",
            "password":"password2"
        }
    ],
    "interval":1
}
```

The interval-key specifies the interval in minutes, after which this script looks for new mails.
